# 1. Client/Frontend Sends HTTP Request:
Client/FrontEnd: This could be a browser or any frontend application that sends a request to the server. The request can be for:
Data (like fetching a web page or JSON data).
Submitting a form.
Triggering an action (like creating a new resource).

# 2. Server Processing (Backend/Business Logic):
Backend/Server Side/Business Model: The server receives the request and determines whether it is a static or dynamic request:
Static request: If itâ€™s a simple request (like retrieving HTML, CSS, or images), the server handles it directly and responds.
Dynamic request: If more complex processing is required, the backend communicates with external APIs to fetch or send data (e.g., requesting data from a database or third-party services).

# 3. API Call (If Required):
API Call: If the backend needs additional information or data, it sends a request to an external API. This could be for data creation, fetching, or modification.
The API processes the request and sends a response, which could include JSON, XML, or some other format.

# 4. API Responds to Server:
The API sends a response back to the backend server. This response could be:
JSON or XML: Typically used formats for transferring data between systems.
Action confirmation: The API confirms that an action, like creating or updating a record, was successful.

# 5. Backend Server Processes API Response:
Once the server receives the API response, it processes the data accordingly.
The backend may render the data into a:
Web page (for display).
JSON data (for AJAX or API-based requests).
Action confirmation (for form submission or other actions).

# 6. Server Sends Response to Client:
After processing, the server sends the appropriate response back to the frontend:
This could be a rendered web page, a confirmation message, or JSON data, depending on the request type.

# 7. Client Receives Result:
The Client/FrontEnd receives the response from the server, which could be:
A web page for the user to view.
A confirmation or a result after submitting data.
Processed JSON or XML data to update the frontend dynamically.
